# Untranslatable_Matching
This project was inspired by a personal fascination of "untranslatable" words -- put simply, words that comprise a particular meaning in one language but is not concisely represented in another langauge (in this case, English). 

At this point, the plan is to hone this project on particular words, for which personal friends can verify the accuracy of the proposed labelling model.
